# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "bilderfassung_steindaten" (Stone Data Image Capture) project - a new repository that was recently initialized with only a basic structure.

## Current State

This is a newly created repository with:
- An empty README.md file
- Initial git commit only
- No source code, dependencies, or build configuration yet
- Project name suggests it will be related to image capture and processing of stone/geological data

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project without established tooling:
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files exist yet
- No build, test, or lint commands are configured
- Development environment and framework choices have not been made

## Next Steps for Development

When adding code to this repository:
1. Determine the primary programming language and framework based on project requirements
2. Set up appropriate package management (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
3. Configure build tools, linting, and testing frameworks
4. Update this CLAUDE.md file with specific commands and architecture details once established

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal:
- README.md (empty)
- .git/ (version control)
- CLAUDE.md (this file)
